Usual approach:

enum class datagram_type
{
    non_reliable = 0,
    reliable = 1
};

virtual ssize_t write_datagram(const char* data, size_t size, stream::datagram_type is_reliable);

Named argument approach:

virtual ssize_t write_datagram(const char* data, size_t size, bool is_reliable:);

and a call:

write_datagram(buf, size, is_reliable: true);


Named arguments must always be named, so the cases like this work:

class rect {
    rect(int left:, int top:, int right:, int bottom:);
    // Named arguments may have default values as well
    rect(int left: = 0, int top: = 0, int width: = 0, int height: = 0);
};

rect r = rect(width: 200, height: 100);
rect r2 = rect(left: 0, right: 200, top: 0, bottom: 100);

Compiler would have to resolve the correct method signature using argument names.

Ambiguity may arise if there are two different signatures with default values
and the call site make it impossible to distinguish one signature from another.
Such programs are malformed.

The order in which named arguments are pushed on stack is implementation
dependent, but most obvious method is to allocate them in order of declaration.

Usual approach:

enum class datagram_type
{
    non_reliable = 0,
    reliable = 1
};

virtual ssize_t write_datagram(const char* data, size_t size, stream::datagram_type is_reliable);

Named argument approach:

virtual ssize_t write_datagram(const char* data, size_t size, bool is_reliable:);

and a call:

write_datagram(buf, size, is_reliable: true);


Named arguments must always be named, so the cases like this work:

class rect {
    rect(int left:, int top:, int width:, int height:);
    rect(int left:, int top:, int right:, int bottom:);
};

rect r = rect(left: 0, width: 200, top: 0, height: 100);

Compiler would have to resolve the correct method signature using argument names.
The order in which named arguments are pushed on stack is implementation dependent, but
most obvious method is to allocate them in order of declaration.
